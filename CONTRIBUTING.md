# How to contribute

## Wanna report a bug or new feature?

Just head over to Github issues.

## Contribute to the codebase?

What we like:

- Small PRs.
- Commit messages that are [clean](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) but also [fun](https://gitmoji.dev/).
- Writing unit tests for critical code.

What we use (you should install these tools in your favorite editor):

- Javascript: typescript, eslint, prettier.
- Python: pylint, black, isort, flake8, mypy, pytest.
